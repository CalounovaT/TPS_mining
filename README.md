# TPS mining project

A thesis project conducted in 2023/2024 at Pluskal lab, IOCB Prague. The project aimed to perform a bioinformatics analysis of characterized terpene synthases and mine putative terpene synthases from large-scale repositories.

## Project organisation

The project is organized into three directories corresponding to different parts of the thesis:
- `01_tps_db_analysis` - analysis of characterized terpene synthases
- `02_mining` - mining of putative terpene synthases
- `03_mining_analysis` - analysis of the mining results

Each directory contains a `README.md` with overview of the directory, and a `Snakefile` pipeline for file processing and creation.

The analysis directories also include `notebooks` directory containing various analysis notebooks.

## Conda and pip
conda and python packages that were used can be found in `requirements.txt`.
